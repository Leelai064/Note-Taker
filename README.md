# Description


This project was created with note taking in mind. Being able to create, save, and delete unneeded notes through exress allows the user to do just that. The end goal is to allow the user to have control on their thoughts and tasks till they are completed. My biggest issue with this homework, was getting Heroku to work properly, I still have some work to do on this project to get the heroku logs to work through.
